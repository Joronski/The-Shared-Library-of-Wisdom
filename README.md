## About
A CCS112 - Application and Emerging Technologies Laboratory Activity 3: collaborative Markdown-based digital encyclopedia built using Git workflows.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a collaborative digital encyclopedia built using Markdown and Git, designed to showcase the practical application of 
emerging technologies and modern software development best practices. It emphasizes:

Version Control: 
Utilizing Git and GitHub to manage contributions, track changes, and ensure seamless collaboration among team members.

Structured Documentation:
Leveraging Markdown for clear, consistent, and easily maintainable content, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

Team Collaboration: 
Encouraging effective teamwork through branching strategies, pull requests, and code reviews, fostering a culture of peer feedback and 
continuous improvement.

Hands-on Learning Experience:
Apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, allowing you to gain confidence in using Git and Markdown while working on a real collaborative 
project, just like in professional software development environments.

The encyclopedia is not only a scalable and user-friendly resource but also a living document that evolves with the contributions of its users. It serves as a 
valuable reference tool for learners, developers, and educators, bridging the gap between theory and practical application in software development.

# Git Workflow Facts

1. **Feature Branching**: This workflow involves creating a dedicated branch for every new feature or task, ensuring that the main branch remains stable and production-ready.
2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Pull requests are used to notify team members that a feature has been completed and is ready for review before being merged into the main codebase.
3. **Reviews**: Code reviews are a critical part of the workflow where team members examine each other's changes to ensure quality and catch potential errors before final integration.

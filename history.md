# History

## Fact 1

Git is Created in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett and Scott Chacon, GitHub is a web-based online source code host that uses Git (a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds) to manage version control of applications. The aim was to help developers more easily collaborate on their code through the use of tools that allow for the sharing of code, the tracking of changes to code, and the management of projects via the internet.

## Fact 2

GitHub grew in popularity almost immediately due to its easy-to-use interface, social-coding features (i.e., forking, pull requests and issue tracking) and strong support for open-source projects. By 2011, GitHub had become the largest publicly accessible source-code host in the world.

## Fact 3

In June of 2018, Microsoft purchased GitHub for $7.5 billion to strengthen its developer ecosystem while maintaining GitHub's openness and independence. Today, GitHub is used by millions of developers; businesses; and other organizations around the globe for software development; collaboration; and project management.
